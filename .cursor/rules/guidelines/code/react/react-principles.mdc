# React Principles

- Functional-first: use function components and hooks, not classes.
- Immutability: treat state and props as immutable.
- Explicitness: use clear, descriptive names and explicit types for public APIs.
- Self-explanatory code: code should communicate intent; avoid comments.
- Simplicity: apply SOLID, YAGNI, and KISS.
