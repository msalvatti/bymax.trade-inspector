# Commit Message Guidelines

Write commit messages that focus on **value delivered** rather than implementation details.

## Structure

### 1. Headline (First Line)

- Start with conventional commit type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Describe the **outcome** or **benefit**, not the action taken
- Keep under 50 characters when possible

### 2. Body (Optional)

- Use bullet points for key improvements
- Focus on:
  - User benefits
  - Business value
  - Developer experience improvements
  - Performance gains
  - Problem solved

### 3. Language Guidelines

- Use active voice and action verbs
- Emphasize impact: enable, enhance, streamline, improve, optimize
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Write for future developers who need to understand **why**, not just **what**

## Examples

### Good ✅

```
feat: introduce real-time chat for team collaboration

- Enable instant communication between race participants
- Enhance community engagement with global chat
- Improve user retention through social features
```

### Avoid ❌

```
feat: add chat components

- Added GlobalChat.tsx to Header.tsx
- Created new migration file for chat_messages table
- Updated imports in multiple files
```

## Quick Reference

| Instead of...                     | Write...                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| "Updated component imports"       | "Streamline component architecture"    |
| "Added chat table to database"    | "Enable persistent messaging"          |
| "Fixed null check in function"    | "Improve application stability"        |
| "Refactored authentication logic" | "Enhance security and user experience" |

Remember: Your commit message should answer "What value does this bring?" not "What files did I change?"
