# Pull Request Guidelines

Write PR titles and descriptions that communicate **business value** and **user impact**, not just technical implementation details.

## PR Title Guidelines

### Structure
```
type(scope): user-focused outcome description
```

### Rules
- **Start with conventional commit type**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, etc.
- **Focus on outcomes**: What value does this deliver to users/developers?
- **Keep concise**: Under 60 characters when possible
- **Use active voice**: "Enable", "Improve", "Add", not "Added" or "Adding"
- **Avoid technical jargon**: Write for product managers and stakeholders

### Examples

**Good ✅**
```
feat: enable real-time collaboration in editor
fix: improve app startup performance by 40%
refactor: streamline authentication user experience  
docs: clarify onboarding process for new contributors
```

**Avoid ❌**
```
feat: add WebSocket connection to ChatProvider
fix: resolve null pointer exception in auth service
refactor: extract UserService into separate module
docs: update README.md with installation steps
```

## PR Description Guidelines

### Structure
1. **🎯 Value Delivered** - The "why" and user impact
2. **📋 Changes Summary** - Key improvements (bullet points)
3. **📝 Context & Rationale** - Background and problem solved
4. **🧪 Testing** - Validation approach
5. **🚀 Deployment Notes** - Any special considerations

### Writing Tips
- **Lead with value**: Start with user/business benefits
- **Use metrics**: Include performance improvements, error reduction, etc.
- **Link context**: Reference Linear tasks, issues, design docs
- **Be specific**: "Reduces load time by 2s" vs "Improves performance"
- **Consider audience**: Write for reviewers, future maintainers, and product team

### Template Usage
Use the repository's `.github/pull_request_template.md` for consistency. The template enforces:
- Value-first communication
- Structured information hierarchy
- Required testing and deployment considerations
- Compliance checklists

## Quick Reference

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Add user authentication" | "Enable secure user accounts and personalization" |
| "Fix bug in payment flow" | "Resolve checkout failures affecting 15% of users" |
| "Refactor database queries" | "Improve app responsiveness with 60% faster data loading" |
| "Update dependencies" | "Enhance security and reduce bundle size by 12%" |

Remember: Your PR should answer **"What problem does this solve and who benefits?"** before explaining implementation details.
